                        <h3>About this Strand</h3>
                        <p>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are intertwining disciplines when applied in the real world. The difference of the STEM curriculum with the other strands and tracks is the focus on advanced concepts and topics.<br><br>A STEM curriculum is designed to provide its students with maximum possible practical exposure and hands-on experience in a particular field. <br><br>This strand will develop the studentsâ€™ ability to evaluate simple to complex societal problems and be responsive and active in the formulation of its solution through the application and integration of scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical concepts as it prepares them to pursue college degrees that focuses on the enigma of the natural world thereby leading them to become future scientists, technological analysts and experts, engineers, mathematicians, programmers, and the like.<br><br></p>
