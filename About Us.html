                CCDC was first envisioned merely to be a Pre-elementary, review and modular computer center. However, with efficient leadership coupled with sufficient educational experiences and warm encouragement from the community elders, the plan has been altered to include grade school, secondary, technical-vocational, tertiary and yes, even graduate education courses and a College of law!<br<br>
            From then on, new programs were offered with the enrollment continuously increasing. The need for expansion was seen, hence, a three-story main building was constructed in a 2,500 lot area in Buyagan, Poblacion, La Trinidad in 1995. At present, the college has three buildings and a gymnasium constructed in a 5,500 sq.m lot and management is on the process negotiating the purchase of another 6,500 sq. m. lot located just adjacent to the present campus for its expansion project. <br><br>
            CCDC was not earlier meant to compete with older and bigger institutions but rather to complement and supplement their efforts in our common goal to educate our youth. However, because members of management have always kept in mind their responsibility to provide quality and relevant education, the performance of the institutionâ€™s graduates are now at par or equal, if not even better than, the graduates of other institutions. <br><br>
                CCDC continues to bloom in its student population coming from all over the region and continues to adhere to the primary goal of providing quality education to the Filipino Youth, particularly to the Cordilleran.
